# Expense

Will be available at https://expense.gustavgb.com.

## Goal

I want to create an app that makes it easy to document previous expenses at regular intervals, to enable an overview of private expenses and divide these into categories. Untimately the user should be able to seamlessly know whether they have spent more than they have earned in a given period (month, week, etc.).

## Stack

This app will be developed using React/Redux for the front-end, Express.js for the web server (SSR, etc.) and Firebase Authentication and Firestore for private and persistent user data.

## Preparation

Make sure you have node and npm set up on your machine, and then run `npm install`

## How to develop

`npm run start`

This will launch webpack dev server, which is available at http://localhost:8080.

## How to build

`npm run build`

Distribute the *dist/* directory.
